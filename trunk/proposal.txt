Description: 
I plan to implement a multi-player car racing game which will use SPOTs as game controller. The host computer connected to base station will display a view of the 2-dimensional space relative to the car of each player. There will be one view per player. Each player will hold a SPOT and control his car using her SPOT. The player can increase or decrease the acceleration of the car, or turn it towards left or right. The 2-dimensional space will contain randomly generated obstructions, and the player needs to avoid colliding her car with any obstruction. Depending on the speed during collision, the car may get damaged or stop for some time. The goal of the player is to reach the target location as fast as possible. The project will allow single person test drive, as well as multi-player (2 or 3) racing. I have worked with Java Swing before, but have not worked with Graphics. So I will keep the graphics part simple as 2-dimensional space display.

Deliverables:
There will be two applications, running on SPOT and Base Station, respectively. The SPOT application will detect movement, tilt and rotation using accelerometer and periodically inform to the base station. The base station will detect available SPOTs, assign player's color to the SPOT, display a view for each player with her color's car and surroundings, receive data from SPOT, and apply appropriate control to her car position in all the views. The base station will keep track of time and announce the winner when the race completes.
