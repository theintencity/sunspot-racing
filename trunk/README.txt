Car Racing Game using SunSPOT
-----------------------------

This is a multi-player car racing game in which a player uses a SunSPOT
to control her car in a 2-dimensional space. There are two NetBeans 
project: Project4SPOT runs on the SPOT and Project4BaseStation runs on
the base-station.

How to Play?
------------

First, deploy the SPOT application to all the SPOTs that the players will
use.

$ cd Project4SPOT
$ ant deploy

Then launch the base-station application to show the user interface.

$ cd Project4BaseStation
$ ant host-run

Now start the SPOTs, so that the user interface shows the player view.
Each player is identified by the SPOT address, and is shown as a color
in the user interface as well as SPOT LED.

You can play it as a single player test-drive or multiplayer competition.

The user interface allows you to configure the map-type and difficulty
level. There are several map-types with different types of obstructions: 
randomly generated blocks, randomly generated maze, randomly generated
moving blocks and open field. There are three difficulty levels: easy,
moderate and difficult. Once you have selected the map type and difficulty
level, you can click on the "New Map" button to generate a new map. If you
notice that in your map you cannot reach from start to finish line because
all paths have obstructions, you should re-generate a new map.

The race starts when you click on the "Start Game" button and stops when
you click on "Stop Game" button. The user input from SPOT is ignored if
the race is not started. A player can start her SPOT after the game has
started, and he will be immediately placed in an ongoing game.

The user interface shows a global map, along with start line, finish line,
obstructions as well as all players, on the left. Individual player view
is shown on the right. The individual player view shows the player's car
at a fixed location, and other map items as relative to the car. The
player view also shows a grid so that it gives the appearance of motion
when your car moves in the map.

The player can control her car using her SPOT. Only the accelerometer
tilt readings in x and y direction are used. The x-tilt controls the 
steering wheel (left and right) angle of the car. The y-tilt controls
the speed (gas, brake and reverse) of the car. The SPOT periodically sends
the tilt readings to the base station application. The tilt angle is used
to update the speed and angle of the player's car. Note that a tilt angle
of -90 to +90 is useful with 0 as no change and -90 and +90 indicating
maximum change in either direction. Tilting more than 90 degrees causes
lower than maximum change.  For speed, negative angle reduces the
speed and positive angle increases the speed. For direction, negative 
angle goes left and positive angle goes right.

The map view and the player view also show the obstructions in the map.
If the player's car collides with the obstruction or map boundary, then
the car's damage count is increased. The increase depends on the speed
of collision. If your car's damage count reaches 100, you lose. Collision
also causes the car's speed to go to zero, and you will have to re-gain
speed. The maximum speed that you can drive a damaged car is lower.

In stationary maps your car cannot cross an obstruction. In a moving map,
although your car cannot cross the obstruction, it is possible that
some moving obstruction moves over your car. Your car cannot be moved if 
an obstruction is moving over it.

All cars start at the start line. Once you cross the finish line, your
finish time is recorded and displayed in your view. Whoever finishes
first in a multi-player game is the winner. The game however continues
so that others can finish and observe their finish time. In a single player
test drive, you can try improving your finish time.

The map type and difficulty level determine your strategy to complete
the race. The change in angle causes a longer turn if your speed is high.
In more congested map, it is suggested to keep your speed low, so that 
you can quickly turn your car, and even if it collides, the damage is not
much. For starters, I suggest first try on the open field, then start
with easy level of random blocks map. The maze map requires more control
and helps in learning how to drive your car.

I have learned in this game that the map view is usually more important
for the less congested map, and you can easily drive looking at the 
direction of your car in the map view. But the player view becomes more
important in congested map (at higher difficulty level) to closely
navigate your car around obstructions.

Software Design
---------------

The checked in source code is well commented. Here I describe the content
of each file at high level.

Project4SPOT.java contains the main application for SPOT, which creates
other threads from DataSender.java and DataReceiver.java. The data sender
thread periodically (every 100 ms) sends the tilt readings in x,y,z to
base station. The data receiver thread receives command to set the color
of the SPOT depending on the address, after the base station assigns a
player color.

The Project4BaseStation.java is the main application for base station.
It creates sender and receiver connections, and launches the ControlPanel.
The ControlPanel is the main user interface controller. It uses the data
model in GameData, and uses other view objects in MapView and PlayerView
to show the user interface. The data model further contains the MapData
to represent the map and obstructions, and PlayerData to represent 
player related information. The MapData is derived into individual map
types such as MapDataBlocks for randomly generated obstructions,
MapDataMaze for randomly generated maze, and MapDataMovingBlocks for 
randomly generated moving blocks. The PlayerData class is the main class
that handles actual car control, position, speed, angle, etc.
There are several 2D graphics related methods in MapView and PlayerView
to display the views.

In terms of difficulty, I spent most time implementing the 2D graphics
transformation. Things like drawing the car in correct direction and
mapping the obstructions from data to view co-ordinates took time.
Although I have created different difficulty level, I haven't yet finished
a race in the difficult level yet. So getting used to driving using
tilt on SunSPOT needs some practice.
